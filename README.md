Most of the code I've written recently is either code for work--which I can't
just share outside of work--or code for IoT devices around the house--which
serves its purpose, but which you wouldn't be able to run anyway. Therefore,
I decided to find an exercise to use for a sample and, since I never did last
year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about), I wrote a
solution to the [final day's problem](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/25).

I know my method is...let's just say a bit over-the-top. The most basic
solution I could think of used string manipulation to find and swap positions
where there was a sea cucumber that could move to an empty space. However, I
decided to pull in some scientific packages and wound up with a solution that
is, in my opinion, much more fun.
